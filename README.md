Simple weather forecast application that I developed for practice to get used to coding Swift before working on companies projects for my internship.

This project helped me understand stack design structure of SwiftUI, asynchronous functions, API calls etc.

XCode makes designing UI easier by implementing their own icons(SFSymbols) and designs.
